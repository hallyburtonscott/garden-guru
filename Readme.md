 React Framework
 
 CSS with Material-UI
 
 Apis: News api, openweather api, openfarm api 
 
 Has Light/Dark mode that is configurable by user, and the info is stored in the database to save settings
 
 Uses "autocompletion" when searching for plants in the plant database: As you type, plants related to your search will begin to appear below, even when you type just one letter. This uses the openfarm filter param in the main get endpoint.
